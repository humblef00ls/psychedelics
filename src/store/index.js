            'Our trail of the compound history of psychedelics starts in the Middle Ages in Europe. People of this time did not have a defined \
            relationship with psychedelics, and there is certainly  speculation and theorising involved in connecting the dots. The first step here is identify\
            when  these interactions took place.\
            Firstly, we do know that some people used psychoactive substances such as mandrake, henbane, and deadly nightshade (belladonna).\
            All of these are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as scopolamine, atropine or hyoscyamine.\
            Another imporant interaction people had with psychedelics was accidentally ingesting ergot, which contains \
            psychoactive alkaloids including lysergic acid (LSD). The next question is how and why did these interactions come to be? ',

            '$/imgs/med_img_1.jpeg$/imgs/med_img_2.jpeg',

            'The first reason for the intentional use of psychedelics that we observe is "medicinal". Despite the toxicities, these plants were, and still are, used in the treatment of a variety of conditions. \
            Psychoactive plants were  used as love philtres, fertility boosters, and a lot of other ointments, fumigations, potions and concoctions.\
            Here we start to see  a very imporant theme, witchcraft.\
            Known as the ‘witches plant’, henbane had great importance during the Middle Ages, being used by magicians and healers in ritual purifications by smoke as well as in the preparation of concoctions,\
             most notably the ‘flying ointments’.\
              Exposure to this ointment, applied mainly to the armpits or the genital area, produced the sensation of flying. Administered rectally after smearing on a stick or pole, this is reputedly the reason why \
              witches are often depicted as flying on broomsticks.\
            Such practices were prosecuted by The Church and many witches were imprisoned, tortured and burnt at the stake.\
            Despite being taken accidentally, even victoms of ergot posioning were persecuted by The Church. This was likely due to the similarities of the symtoms ergot poisoning\
            and the symptoms of the other psychoactive substances. These included seizures, hallucinations and convulsions. Ergot Rye poisoning is also theorised to be the cause\
            of the \'dancing mania\' that manifested in Europe (Saint Vitus dance). \
            In truth however, witchcraft was often viewed with skepticism, and witches of this era weren’t perceived as satanic. It wasn\'t until late the 1500s that the great \'witch hunt\' of Europe began.\
            This leads us to the final question: Why did The Church start hunting witches and criminalize the use of psychedelics? ',

            '$/imgs/med_img_3.jpeg$/imgs/med_img_5.jpeg',

            'While there are two dominant theories about the motives and cause for the witch hunt, one about bad weather causing mass hyteria, and one about\
            the economic rivalry between churches, our focus will be on the latter which is backed by quantifiable data.\
            Until the 1500s, the Catholic Church had claimed a monopoly on religion. It labeled proponents of other religions “heretics” and either forced their conversion or simply killed them withinquisitions and crusades.\
            With the German monk Martin Luther, however, this stopped working. Protestantism emerged as the first truly viable challenger to the Catholic church’s hold on the population. \
            Among both Catholics and Protestants, witch-hunting became a prime way for attracting and appeasing the masses by demonstrating their Satan-fighting prowess.\
            It was the simple stratergy of stoking fears about an outside threat and then assuring people that you, and you alone, can protect them (Sound familiar to politics today?). \
            This concept goes a long way toward explaining not just why witch-hunting mania exploded in Europe, but also why it took hold where it did: Germany.\
            The context here is best summarized by Voltaire, who famously remarked that the Holy Roman Empire was “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire”. \

            '$L/imgs/med_img_4.jpeg',

            '\
            By following the compound histroy of psychedelics in this setting, we uncover context about the geo-political conflicts of the time.\
            Humans have sought to fight for power ever since the concept has existed. For their greater goal of maintaining their position, The Catholic Church pushed onto \
            the people a stigmatized view on psychedelics. \
            From here, we will see how the Church\'s\
            position on the use of psychedelics would go on to have consequences that would dictate their compound history in other cultures and settings.\

            'While the people’s relationship with psychedelics has been complex to say the least, what ultimately decides a substance\'s place \
            in society is the government. A negative view of the substance by the authorities will translate into stigmatisation and criminalisation,\
             which will only serve to enforce a negative view of the substance by the people. Thus, it is empirical to look at how psychedelics have been \
             used as tools of governance, as well as how governments have reacted to use of psychedelics.',
            'The former can be observed by analysing the actions of the Catholic Church during the medieval era in Europe. After the fall of the Roman \
            Empire in the 5th century, there emerged no single powerful secular government in the West. This power vacuum was filled by the Catholic \
            Church, making them the strongest and richest organisation of the time. Given this position, the Church’s stigmatisation of psychedelics \
             had a far reaching impact on society. For their ultimate goal of hoarding power, the Church ramped up witch hunts after the appearance\
              of the Protestant Church. Economists Peter Leeson and Jacob Russ lay out their argument that the two churches advertised their \
               finesse at persecuting witches as proof that they were the best church to join if you wanted protection from Satan. One of the \
               key ways the Church identified someone as a witch was by their use of magic mushrooms and other herbs.  Many herbalists were women \
               living in rural areas where herbs were found and collected. In truth, the Church had always known that these ‘witches’ were not\
                actually satan worshipers and also knew that they weren’t capable of real harm. As is with most things involving people wanting\
                 to keep their power, psychedelics were just a tool for a larger goal.',

            'Psychedelics have had a contentious relationship with ethics throughout history. In pre-columbian times psychedelics \
            were used as medicine and in religious ceremonies to receive signs from gods. They used these without any research\
             being done beforehand. This was expected as formal research had never been conducted before. Within the 1880s, \
             scientists wanted to conduct formal research on psychedelics during the peyote boom. However, they did not follow \
             today’s ethical standards. Irreconcilable limbo of science and spirituality, used sacramentally by Indigenous cultures\
              as a gateway to a mystical plane of existence, psychedelics have been slippery substances to integrate into our colonial, \
              scientific society. Recently, psychedelics have become increasingly considered by experts in mental health, mindfulness, \
              and cognitive science to have tremendous potential to both treat neuroses and challenge long standing beliefs dwindling in \
              utility. This recent movement is to contest perceptions of psychedelics forged during the ‘60s and ‘70s, during which \
              psychedelics were seen as dangerous and were associated with anti-war hippies; thus, a panicked government backlash was \
              sparked, eventually leading to the classification of psychedelics as “addictive” schedule I substances. The West has had \
              a controversial, almost cyclic relationship with psychedelics. They were originally perceived as entheogens, substances used to bring forth the divine from within, but we cannot help but view them through a scientific lens--we disregard refined Indigenous practices in which psychedelics were used for healing and spiritual guidance. Current research is primarily focused on developing better treatments for mental disorders including PTSD, substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety. This is human-centered research, but the issue is that academia is still limited in funding and underdeveloped in paradigms. Hopefully, future focus will narrow in on the mystical experiences themselves that are richly complex and ripe with opportunity for research, allowing for a gentle intertwinement of science and spirituality.',
