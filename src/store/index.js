            'Our trail of the compound history of psychedelics starts in the Middle Ages in Europe. People of this time did not have a well defined \
            relationship with psychedelics, and there is certainly  speculation and theorising involved in connecting the dots. The first step here is identify\
            when  these interactions took place.\
            Firstly, we do know that some people used psychoactive substances such as mandrake, henbane, and deadly nightshade (belladonna).\
            All of these are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as scopolamine, atropine or hyoscyamine.\
            Another imporant interaction people had with psychedelics was accidentally ingesting ergot, which contains \
            psychoactive alkaloids including lysergic acid (LSD). The next question is how and why did these interactions come to be? ',

            '$/imgs/med_img_1.jpeg$/imgs/med_img_2.jpeg',

            'The first reason for the intentional use of psychedelics that we observe is "medicinal". Despite the toxicities, these plants were, and still are, used in the treatment of a variety of conditions. \
            Psychoactive plants were  used as love philtres, fertility boosters, and a lot of other ointments, fumigations, potions and concoctions.\
            Here we start to see  a very imporant theme, witchcraft.\
            Known as the ‘witches plant’, henbane had great importance during the Middle Ages, being used by magicians and healers in ritual purifications by smoke as well as in the preparation of concoctions,\
             most notably the ‘flying ointments’.\
              Exposure to this ointment, applied mainly to the armpits or the genital area, produced the sensation of flying. Administered rectally after smearing on a stick or pole, this is reputedly the reason why \
              witches are often depicted as flying on broomsticks.\
            Such practices were prosecuted by The Church and many witches were imprisoned, tortured and burnt at the stake.\
            Despite being taken accidentally, even victoms of ergot posioning were persecuted by The Church. This was likely due to the similarities of the symtoms ergot poisoning\
            and the symptoms of the other psychoactive substances. These included seizures, hallucinations and convulsions. Ergot Rye poisoning is also theorised to be the cause\
            of the \'dancing mania\' that manifested in Europe (Saint Vitus dance). \
            In truth however, witchcraft was often viewed with skepticism, and witches of this era weren’t perceived as satanic. It wasn\'t until late the 1500s that the great \'witch hunt\' of Europe began.\
            This leads us to the final question: Why did The Church start hunting witches and criminalize the use of psychedelics? ',

            '$/imgs/med_img_3.jpeg$/imgs/med_img_5.jpeg',

            'While there are two dominant theories about the motives and cause for the witch hunt, one about bad weather causing mass hyteria, and one about\
            the economic rivalry between churches, our focus will be on the latter which is backed by quantifiable data.\
            Until the 1500s, the Catholic Church had claimed a monopoly on religion. It labeled proponents of other religions “heretics” and either forced their conversion or simply killed them withinquisitions and crusades.\
            With the German monk Martin Luther, however, this stopped working. Protestantism emerged as the first truly viable challenger to the Catholic church’s hold on the population. \
            Among both Catholics and Protestants, witch-hunting became a prime way for attracting and appeasing the masses by demonstrating their Satan-fighting prowess.\
            It was the simple stratergy of stoking fears about an outside threat and then assuring people that you, and you alone, can protect them (Sound familiar to politics today?). \
            This concept goes a long way toward explaining not just why witch-hunting mania exploded in Europe, but also why it took hold where it did: Germany.\
            The context here is best summarized by Voltaire, who famously remarked that the Holy Roman Empire was “neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire”. \

            '\
            By following the compound histroy of psychedelics in this setting, we uncover context about the geo-political conflicts of the time.\
            Humans have sought to fight for power ever since the concept has existed. For their greater goal of maintaining their position, The Catholic Church pushed onto \
            the people a stigmatized view on psychedelics (Similar to how cannabis was criminalized in the US for political goals). \
            From here, we will see how the Church\'s\
            position on the use of psychedelics would go on to have consequences that would dictate their compound history in other cultures and settings.\

            'In many ways, the relationship the people of the Aztec empire had with psychedelics was a direct inversion of what we just saw in Medeival Europe.\
            Here, psychedelics actually held an important role in society in religious contexts and their use was not only tolerated but in fact integral to several\
            ceremonies. The benefit of analysing this settings is that here we get to see the two juxtaposing views of psychedelics interact with each other. This will\
            not only help us follow the compound histroy of psychedelics, but also reveal to us the motives and beliefs of the people from both cultures.',

            '$/imgs/az_img_1.jpeg$/imgs/az_img_2.jpeg',

            'Teonanácatl, or more simply known as God\'s Flesh, was a key part of religious activities and rituals in the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan. The magic mushrooms allowed those who ingested them to speak directly to God, heal diseases, and even induce sexual ecstacy.\
            Mesoamerican tribes had had a long and deep cultural use of hallucinogens, including Psilocybe mushrooms. These mushrooms were often used to commune with the gods, to divine, and for recreation.\
            Archaeologists have found evidence of ritual use of mushrooms by the Aztecs and Mazatecs as early as 200 AD. Mushroom stones and motifs, statuettes, drawings, and recorded history report mushroom use in Guatemala, Mexico, Colima, and throughout the rest of Central America.\
            This however, changed forver with the invasion of the Spanish conquistadors in 1519.',

            'This usage of magic mushrooms was quickly suppressed by Catholic missionaries, who saw the shakes, convulsions, and ravings of patients who had consumed the mushrooms as communication with the devil. Despite this, usage continued, often in private.\
            The first medical record of humans consuming magic mushrooms dates to the late 1500s, and was written by Fray Bernardino de Sahágun:\
            “They ate mushrooms before dawn when they also drank cacao. They ate the mushrooms with honey and when they began to feel excited due to the effect of the mushrooms, the Indians started dancing, while some were singing and others weeping. Thus was the intoxication produced by the mushrooms. Some Indians who did not care to sing sat down in their rooms remaining there as if to think.”\
            Natives were punished by death when caught with the mushrooms, and their public use became less common.\
            Here we see the clash of values and beliefs of these two cultures, proxied through our compound.\
            The questions to ask here are what role did this play in the goal of the invaders and what can this tell us about the setting?',

            '$/imgs/az_img_3.webp',

            'It is no secret that the common European view of the time of indigenous people was that they were inferior culturally, technologically, and religiously.\
            The Spanish conquistadors were essentially sanctioned pirates. Their goals primarily focused on stealing wealth for their country and civilizing the natives with Catholicism.\
            Spain hoped to pacify areas that held extractable natural resources such as iron, tin, copper, salt, silver, gold, etc.\
            In the papal bull of 1508, Universalis Ecclesiae (Of the Universal Church), Pope Julius II declared that the king of Spain would be the head of the Church in Spain and its empire. Such an empowerment clearly meant that along with Spanish law, governance, language, and culture, the Roman Catholic religion, too, would cross from Europe to the Americas and that the king of Spain would engage in the spread of Christianity to the native peoples of the New World.\
            Thus, while not just for the sake of making the locals subservient to them, there clearly was econimic motive behind the religious conversion.\
            Bringing this context of motivation into the picture tells us why the Spanish Missionaries did what they did. Seeing the natives partake in the use of psychedelics, something the Church considered heresy, served as yet another avenue where\
            they could displace the local culture and religion, and squeeze the Indians into the mold of Spanish culture.\
            ',

            '$/imgs/az_img_4.jpeg$/imgs/az_img_5.jpeg',

            'There is a striking parallel here to what the Church did back in the Old World (See section "Medieval Europe"). Once again, the compound histroy of psychedelics\
            was tied to and shaped by authorities with the ambition of power. Of course, this time the scale was powerful armies invading a foreign land, and if not for the diseases\
            the Europeans brought over with them who knows how things would have played out. Ultimately, this conquest had several important consequences that shaped history\
            , including things like cultural genocide, the death of millions of natives, a global rush to colonise the New World, the birth of the vile Encomienda system, etc.'

            in society is the government. A negative view of the substance by the authorities will translate into stigmatisation and criminalisation,\
             which will only serve to enforce a negative view of the substance by the people. Thus, it is empirical to look at how psychedelics have been \
             used as tools of governance, as well as how governments have reacted to use of psychedelics.',
            'The former can be observed by analysing the actions of the Catholic Church during the medieval era in Europe. After the fall of the Roman \
            Empire in the 5th century, there emerged no single powerful secular government in the West. This power vacuum was filled by the Catholic \
            Church, making them the strongest and richest organisation of the time. Given this position, the Church’s stigmatisation of psychedelics \
             had a far reaching impact on society. For their ultimate goal of hoarding power, the Church ramped up witch hunts after the appearance\
              of the Protestant Church. Economists Peter Leeson and Jacob Russ lay out their argument that the two churches advertised their \
               finesse at persecuting witches as proof that they were the best church to join if you wanted protection from Satan. One of the \
               key ways the Church identified someone as a witch was by their use of magic mushrooms and other herbs.  Many herbalists were women \
               living in rural areas where herbs were found and collected. In truth, the Church had always known that these ‘witches’ were not\
                actually satan worshipers and also knew that they weren’t capable of real harm. As is with most things involving people wanting\
                 to keep their power, psychedelics were just a tool for a larger goal.',

             being done beforehand. This was expected as formal research had never been conducted before. Within the 1880s, \

Current research is primarily focused on developing better treatments for mental disorders including PTSD, substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety.
