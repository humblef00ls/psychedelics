    It is no accident that psychedelics have had such rippling effects on cultures throughout history—when taken with care, they bring forth insightful experiences that can allow the user a chance to reorder their minds and be washed over with feelings of love and spiritual connection. Consequently, their mysterious qualities have driven people to react to them in unpredictable ways. What we have established with our timeline is a nonlinear development of our relationship with psychedelics as a society, where it even seems that ancient civilisations were more progressive than us today. Once perceived as entheogenic substances by indigenous cultures, psychedelics are now usually reduced to being perceived as drugs; drugs are recreational, they affect the mind in a specific way, and they may be exploited. Directly resulting from this perspective, which has been especially elevated by the government, psychedelics have been used over the past century with diminished care and ethical consideration.

    In order to even think about the future of psychedelics in our lives, we must first ask ourselves what is different now than all the previous times in history? The answer here is certainly more research. While medical research into psychedelics is not a new idea, psychedelic research has been gaining significant traction after a 25-year hiatus broken by scientists in Germany, the United States, and Switzerland. There now exists a foundation of human neuroimaging, psychology, and psychopharmacology studies with psychedelics. These foundational studies complement a small number of early phase clinical trials. There are now positive preliminary reports on the safety and tolerability of psilocybin for obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol and tobacco addiction; LSD for end-of-life psychological distress; and both ayahuasca and psilocybin for major depressive disorder (Carhart-Harris et al.).

    While psychedelics’ place in everyday society is unlikely to suddenly change given their legal status (Schedule 1 or equivalent, in most places), it does certainly seem like the avenue of medicinal use has been revived for psychedelics. Advocacy and the research dedicated to psychedelics have begun to shift public perceptions towards therapeutic uses of these substances. Departments and scientists with reputations for high-quality, socially responsible, ethically sound, and positively transformative research are helping to revive this alternate identity. As a result, a rising tide of legislation spanning a number of cities and states has recently culminated in a 2021 historic legalization and state-mandated funding of psilocybin-assisted therapy.

    As has been demonstrated, psychedelics have assumed many roles throughout their volatile history. They have been the center of sacramental rituals, been an associative source of stigma, sparked cultural movements, healed mental illnesses, and been used widely as devices for addressing existential issues. Our hope for the future of psychedelics is for them to  finally be afforded the scientific understanding we give other compounds, and their place in society to be discerned by empirical findings and not dictated by our elastic morals. The evidence speaks for itself: the psychedelic aura echoes deep within the human psyche.
