    What we have established with our timeline is the nonlinear development of our relationship with psychedelics as a society, where it seems like ancient civilisations were more progressive than us today. In order to even think about the future of psychedelics in our lives, we must first ask ourselves what is different now than all the previous times in history? The answer here is certainly more research. While medical research into psychedelics is not a new idea, psychedelic research has been gaining significant traction after a 25-year hiatus broken by scientists in Germany (Hermle, 1992), the United States (Strassman and Qualls, 1994), and Switzerland (Vollenweider, 1997). There now exists a foundation of human neuroimaging , psychology, and psychopharmacology studies with psychedelics.

    These foundational studies complement a small number of early phase clinical trials. There are now positive preliminary reports on the safety and tolerability of psilocybin for obsessive compulsive disorder (Moreno et al, 2006), psilocybin, and LSD for end-of-life psychological distress (Gasser et al, 2014), psilocybin for alcohol (Bogenschutz et al, 2015), and tobacco addiction (Johnson et al, 2014) and ayahuasca and psilocybin for major depressive disorder (Osorio Fde et al, 2015).

    While psychedelicsâ€™ place in everyday society is not going  to suddenly change given their Schedule 1 classification (or equivalent, in most places), it does certainly seem like the avenue of medicinal use has been revived for psychedelics. Advocacy and the findings of entire research departments dedicated to psychedelics have begun to tip public perceptions in favor of these alternative therapeutics. As a result, a rising tide of legislation spanning a number of cities and states has recently culminated in a 2021 historic legalization and state-mandated funding of psilocybin-assisted therapy. Our hope for the future of psychedelics is for them to  finally be afforded the scientific understanding we give other compounds, and their place in society to be discerned by empirical findings and not dictated by our elastic morals.
